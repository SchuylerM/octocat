	 * TODO:
	 * ****
	 *  Write a program that interfaces with the console, and as you write any text it gives you a random scrubs quote
	 *  the program should only give a quote if it receives text (if it's given blank text, it should say 'you must talk in order to get a scrubs quote.')
	 *  the program will exit when the user types 'go away'.  Bonus points if it is case insensitive (GO AWAY and Go Away would make the program exit)
