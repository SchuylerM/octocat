	 * 
	 * 	1) write a method that accepts an array of characters (char[]) and returns true if the array is all unique characters, otherwise false
	 *  2) write a method that accepts an array of characters (char[]) and returns an array of unique characters.
	 *  3) write a method that accepts an array of characters (char[]) and returns the reversed order of that list ([a,b,c,d] -> [d,c,b,a]) 
	 * 
	 * Caution, if you look for help on the web of these problems you may stumble upon the solutions which will take the fun out of it, and you won't learn as much.
